This is a repository that I am doing just to become familiar with Github.  The first thing that came to mind was The Red Rocker, Mr. Sammy Hagar.  I must have been playing his songs in the gym today. I am looking at Github as potentially a place that I can write, learn more about Github and its capabilities, and then also take advantage of some thing like version control for documents.
